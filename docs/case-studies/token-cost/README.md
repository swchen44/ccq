# Case Study — Does ccq actually pay off? (real Claude Code A/B: tokens, cost, completion)

The skeptical question every decision-maker asks: *"There are a hundred code tools on GitHub —
why build and **maintain** another one? What do I get?"* This case study answers it with **real,
reproducible numbers**, not marketing.

We run the **same** AI coding agent (Claude Code, headless, `--model sonnet`) on the **same tasks**,
changing exactly **one** thing: whether `ccq` is available. We read the **actual** token usage and
USD cost straight from each run's `--output-format json` (no estimates), score the answer against
ground truth, and repeat **N=3** per cell. Raw per-run JSON is kept under [`raw/`](raw/) for audit.

> **Half of real-world C lives with no build system** (no `compile_commands.json`). So two of the
> five tasks run on **wpa_supplicant in no-build mode** — the scenario that matters most for intranet
> firmware/driver code.

## TL;DR

| | with ccq vs without |
|---|---|
| **Token cost** | **1.8×–7.9× fewer** tokens per task (more on call-graph questions) |
| **Dollar cost** | **2.1×–12.4× cheaper** per task; **6.7× cheaper** over the whole suite ($5.47 → $0.81) |
| **Speed** | ~**6× faster** wall-clock (e.g. 162s → 13s on blast-radius) |
| **Completion** | one no-build task the agent **could not solve at all without ccq** (0% vs 100%) |
| **Predictability** | across 3 identical runs, baseline cost swings up to **15×** (CV ≈ 48%); ccq is **flat** (CV ≈ 4%) |
| **Turns** | grep+read loops for **9–33 tool turns**; ccq answers in **2–4** |

These hold even though Claude Sonnet is a strong model that *can* grep-and-read its way to most
answers — it just burns far more tokens, time, and turns doing it, and **fails outright on
function-pointer dispatch in no-build code**.

**Savings (baseline ÷ ccq):** T1 5.5× tok / 8.9× $ · T2 7.9× / 10.3× · T3 7.5× / **12.4×** ·
T4 3.2× / 2.7× · T5 1.8× / 2.1×. Cost ratios beat token ratios because ccq's answers are short and
its few turns ride a warm cache.

## The finding that isn't about cost: completion (T5, no-build)

T1–T4 end in the same answer — ccq just gets there ~5× cheaper. **T5 is different.** Asked to explain
`hostapd_driver_scan` in **no-build** wpa_supplicant, the baseline agent had to name its callees. It
found the indirect call site and stopped there — across **all 3 runs** it answered (translated):

> "the only callee is the function pointer `hapd->driver->scan2`… the real driver implementation
> (e.g. `nl80211_scan2`) is bound at runtime"

— i.e. it **could not resolve the dispatch** (and even guessed the wrong handler). Ground truth is
`wpa_driver_wext_scan`, registered as the `.scan2` field. ccq's fn-pointer synthesizer resolves it
**every time (100%)**. This is the structural blind spot of grep/read: *runtime function-pointer
dispatch is invisible to text search*, and it's exactly where no-build C (drivers, ops tables,
callbacks) lives. No amount of extra tokens fixes a 0%.

## The third axis: predictability (variance across identical runs)

Average cost is half the story. We ran each task **3 times, identically** — does the cost hold steady?
For the baseline it does **not**: same question, wildly different bills depending on which grep/read
rabbit holes the agent wanders into. ccq stays flat because it offloads the *search* to a
deterministic index — the agent makes the same ~2 tool calls every time.

| Task | baseline runs (tokens) | baseline max/min | ccq runs (tokens) | ccq max/min |
|------|------------------------|-----------------:|-------------------|------------:|
| T1 | 219k / 255k / 404k | 1.8× | 53k / 53k / 53k | 1.0× |
| T2 | 254k / 289k / 722k | 2.8× | 53k / 53k / 53k | 1.0× |
| T3 | **65k / 151k / 1,002k** | **15.4×** | 54k / 54k / 54k | 1.0× |
| T4 | 152k / 188k / 195k | 1.3× | 56k / 56k / 56k | 1.0× |
| T5 | 32k / 150k / 150k | 4.7× | 53k / 53k / 82k | 1.5× |
| **mean** | — | **5.2×** | — | **1.1×** |

**Coefficient of variation: baseline ≈ 48%, ccq ≈ 4%.** The extreme is T3 (transitive blast radius):
the *same* question cost **65k tokens on a lucky run and 1,002k on an unlucky one** — a 15× swing,
because the baseline agent's cost depends on how deep its recursive grep/read goes. ccq answered it in
54k ± 0.1% every time. For anyone **budgeting** agent spend, this matters as much as the mean: ccq
turns a slot-machine cost into a flat, forecastable one.

## ROI — what a decision-maker actually wants

All assumptions are explicit and adjustable; the **ratios** above are the robust part, the absolute
dollars scale with your model and volume.

| Input (illustrative) | Value |
|---|---|
| Avg saving per code-understanding query (baseline − ccq, sonnet) | ~**$0.31** |
| Engineers using AI agents on C/C++ | 50 |
| Such queries / engineer / workday | 10 |
| Workdays / year | 230 |
| **Queries / year** | **115,000** |
| **Annual token-cost saved (sonnet)** | **≈ $35,000** |
| Same on a frontier model (~5× price) | **≈ $175,000** |
| Engineer time saved (~80s/query × 115k) | **≈ 2,500 hours/year** |

**Maintenance cost on the other side of the ledger:** ccq is a **single zero-dependency Go binary +
one skill file**. Even at **one-tenth** of every assumption above (5 engineers, 1 query/day),
it still saves **~$3,500/yr + 250 hrs/yr** — far more than it costs to keep a static binary building
in CI. And the token/time savings are the *measurable* part; the unmeasured part is the no-build
fn-pointer tasks an agent **silently gets wrong** without it.

## Honest caveats (so this isn't marketing)

- **Fair A/B:** identical model (`sonnet`) and identical task prompt for both arms; the only
  difference is `ccq` on `$PATH`. The baseline genuinely **cannot** call ccq (it's PATH-excluded,
  `command not found`) — not "asked nicely not to."
- **Real numbers, not a proxy:** tokens and `total_cost_usd` come from each run's Claude Code
  session JSON; every run is saved in [`raw/`](raw/).
- **Non-determinism is shown, not hidden:** N=3 per cell; baseline is **high-variance** (T3 ranged
  $0.20–$1.15, T2 $0.20–$0.78) while ccq is tight ($0.02–$0.10). Means are reported above.
- **Prompts are neutral:** T2/T5 ask the natural developer question ("who triggers / what does it
  call"); they do **not** reveal the `.scan2` mechanism, so neither arm is coached.
- **ccq was warm** (`ccq wait-index` first), which is its intended use; first-ever cold index adds a
  one-time ~10–30s (see the [index-control](../index-control/README.md) case study).
- **Scope:** 5 tasks on 2 repos; this measures call-graph / understanding queries, where ccq is
  built to win — not, say, prose generation.

## Reproduce

```bash
# needs: claude CLI, ccq on ~/git/ccq/ccq, redis + wpa_supplicant under cbm-vs-codegraph-bench/repos
cd docs/case-studies/token-cost
python3 run_ab.py --tasks T1 --runs 1     # calibrate one task cheaply
python3 run_ab.py --runs 3                # full suite, N=3  (~$6 of API, ~30 min)
python3 run_ab.py --report                # rebuild the tables from raw/
```

Tasks + ground truth live in [`tasks.json`](tasks.json); the harness is [`run_ab.py`](run_ab.py).
